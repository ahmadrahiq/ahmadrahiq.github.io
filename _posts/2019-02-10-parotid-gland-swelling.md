Get a 500ml bottle of distilled Water from the nearest supermarket. Pour out about 250 ml of water from the bottle to leave some airspace. Insert 1 pills (If the remedy is in pills form) from the remedy into the bottle and shake the bottle hard 10 times in a row (10 strokes of equal strength). Shaking the bottle hard is homeopathic succession which is done to enhance the medicinal power of the remedy.

Please take only 5 drops of the reconstituted dilution of 250 ml using a disposable dropper 3 times at a gap of 3 hours. This is to be done for one day only.

Please shake the bottle hard 10 times in a row (10 strokes of equal strength) every time before taking 5 drops from this bottle using a disposable dropper which can be used as a dose.

3/. Avoid coffee, tea (including green), and other sources of caffeine such as some fizzy drinks and large amounts of chocolate, except where this would cause a drastic change in consumption

Dear Rahiq,

7 days have passed since I tried the remedy, I was able to find the liquid dilution after all. Took the remedy on Friday 10/29. The pain was severe that day and the day before, I did not eat 2-3 days to avoid the pain.
After taking the remedy I observed the following:
- No drastic or immediate changes.
- Friday night 10/29 I noticed a itchy sensation on my left eye (tear duct)- which used to swell several years ago after some type of allergic reaction.
- Saturday night 10/30 the gland duct was UNBLOCKED and was able to manually drain the saliva which had an unpleasant taste.
- Sunday 10/31 - Bad tasting saliva kept draining from the gland and I was able to eat without excessive swelling and pain.
- Monday 11/1 - Gland was back to normal, no swelling, did not need to manually drain it.
- Tuesday 11/2 - Itchy thoat, cough with burntaste, hoarse voice (all these symptoms lasted only 2 days and were minor)

Overall, the gland is doing well, I don't notice anymore when saliva comes out, no swelling at all. I only have a minor pulsating pain that comes and goes. My moodiness is gone, my fluid retention is gone. I have two more question for you? Is a specific remedy for an acute gland obstruction or is it a constitutional remedy for me? Would you recommend taking the same dose if the problem comes back?

I really appreciate your advice and the time you spent on my case. It meant a lot to me as I was in terrrible pain.

Sincerely,
Norma (Real Name)

Dear Norma,

&gt; Is a specific remedy for an acute gland obstruction or is it a constitutional remedy for me?

It’s hard to say that . Sol. is your constitutional remedy but I can tell you that Merc. Sole. is the best suited remedy for your present condition.

&gt; Would you recommend taking the same dose if the problem comes back?

Sorry to say, No!

If the problem come back, may be it will come with some changed symptoms which can indicate to same remedy or any other remedy according to overall physical and mental condition.

So, please inform us before taking any more doses of Merc. Sol. or any other remedy whatever the cause is.

Please report back after 15 days.
